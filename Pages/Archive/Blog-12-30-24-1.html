		<p>This is an excerpt from my journal, just wanted to post something as it's been a while.</p>
		<p>
			I'm tired. I've got a headache, I'm slow today. I'm realizing in a way, I'm not getting any younger. I need to make things easier, not harder. That doesn't mean getting rid of my ambition though. I'm realizing I spent a lot of effort in the past week on my journal, and website, and shit I ultimately don't care THAT much about. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't impact much, and I want to stop working on it. I want to work and upload shit that interests me. It's actually kind of a hassle uploading stuff to the internet. At least the way I do it. I want to make and document more shit worth uploading.
		</p>
		<p>I'm gonna go work on that now, thanks for reading.</p>
